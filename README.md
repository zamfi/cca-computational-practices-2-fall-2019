# Computational Practices 2, Fall 2019

This course repository contains homework assignments, useful guides, and code for Computational Practices 2 at CCA, Fall 2019.

In this course, we'll engage in three mini-projects and a final project.

*Pre-project assignment*: find two computational works and deconstruct them -- figure out what subcomponents you'd need to create or find in order to recreate the work. Upload your work to a [new GitHub repository](https://github.xom/zamfi/github-guide) and [email me the link](mailto:zamfi@cca.edu).

Project 1: JavaScript, React, and the Web. *September 16 - October 7.*

Project 2: Electronics and Robotics. *October 7 - October 28.*

Project 3: Machine Learning. *October 28 - November 11.*

Final Project: November 11 - December 14; final show *Interface*, 7pm-9pm, CCA Oliver Art Center (Oakland)
