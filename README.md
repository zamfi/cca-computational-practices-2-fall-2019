# Computational Practices 2, Fall 2019

This course repository contains homework assignments, useful guides, and code for Computational Practices 2 at CCA, Fall 2019.

In this course, we'll engage in three mini-projects and a final project.

*Pre-project assignment*: 
1. Find two computational works and deconstruct them -- figure out what subcomponents you'd need to create or find in order to recreate the work. Upload your work to a [new GitHub repository](https://github.xom/zamfi/github-guide) and [email me the link](mailto:zamfi@cca.edu).
2. Learn about JSON, aka "JavaScript Object Notation". It's a very useful way to structure data and you will come across it a lot, including in Project 1! There are a number of resources on YouTube and across the Web, but many of them will have parts that assume knowledge beyond what you have gained so far -- do not fret! Get what you can from each one, and move on. The pieces will fit together!

[Project 1: JavaScript, React, and the Web. *September 16 - October 7.*](project1.md)

Project 2: Electronics and Robotics. *October 7 - October 28.*

Project 3: Machine Learning. *October 28 - November 11.*

Final Project: November 11 - December 14; final show *Interface*, 7pm-9pm, CCA Oliver Art Center (Oakland)
